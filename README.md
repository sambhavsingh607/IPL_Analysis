# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Project

This project presents a detailed analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using Python. The goal is to uncover insights from the IPL dataset, including team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, and more through data wrangling and visualization techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

The notebook performs the following:

- Loads and processes IPL match and delivery datasets
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizes key trends and patterns
- Derives insights on:
  - Team performances
  - Toss decisions and match outcomes
  - Player statistics (e.g., most runs, most wickets)
  - Venue and season trends

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly` (optional)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `IPL.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing code and visualizations
- `matches.csv` – Dataset containing match-level information
- `deliveries.csv` – Dataset containing ball-by-ball information

> **Note**: Ensure you have the `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` files in the same directory as the notebook for it to run properly.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sambhavsingh607/IPL-Data-Analysis.git
